# Weather Prediction Using RNN 🌦️

This project uses **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** to predict weather data, such as temperature trends, using time-series forecasting. Implemented in Python using deep learning frameworks, this notebook processes and models sequential weather data to make accurate predictions.

## 📌 Project Overview

* **Goal**: Predict future weather conditions based on historical data.
* **Technique**: RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
* **Tools Used**:

  * Python
  * TensorFlow / Keras
  * NumPy / Pandas
  * Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
* **Data**: Real-time or historical weather data formatted as time series.

## 📁 Files

* `Weather.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing all steps — data preprocessing, model building, training, and prediction.
* `README.md`: Project overview and documentation (you’re reading it!).

## 🔧 Features
